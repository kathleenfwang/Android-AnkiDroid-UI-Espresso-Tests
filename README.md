# Onramp Android Take Home Project 

## Overview 🤖

Congratulations for making it this far in the interview process for the SiriusXM + Pandora Apprenticeship at Onramp! This project seeks to better inform the Onramp team of your experience with the Kotlin, testing, and Android development. This is also designed to prepare you for your interview at SiriusXM + Pandora, as well

You will have seven days to complete this project. We expect those who have a moderate level of Android development experience to spend between 30 and 40 hours to design, implement, document, and submit the project to us. Depending on your level, it may take more or less time, so please plan accordingly.

**The project is due on [DUE DATE] at 9:00am PT/ 12:00pm ET**

#### Project Summary:
*   Total time available to complete: 7 days
*   Due date/time: [DUE DATE]
*   Expected development time to complete: 30 - 40 hours 
*   Required stack/tools: a computer with Android Studio

For this project, you will be writing tests within an existing application called Anki. You'll find more information on this project at the bottom of this README.


#### Android App Requirements
For this project, we want you to add tests to an existing Android application, AnkiDroid, which you'll find information for at the bottom of this README.

**Scope your testing coverage to what you can reasonably accomplish by the due date. Your application must include the following testing requirements:**

Test some of the following components:
*   Complete test coverage of at least 10 features/actions (Ex: Floating action button, New Card Creation, Log in flow, etc)
    * Floating Action Button
    * New Card Creation
    * Log in flow
    * Viewing Cards
*   
*   
*   

**Note: you will need to detail where and how your Android App meets these requirements in your repository's README file when you submit your project.**

#### A Note on Researching and Plagiarism

You are actively encouraged to research the web, books, videos, or tutorials for this project. That said, we expect all code that is submitted to be your own (e.g. this project should **NOT** be completed with another person). That means that we expect each candidate to refrain from copying and/or pasting code into the project. If we find copied code in your project, we will have to disqualify you. We’ve included some suggested web and video resources at the end of this document.

## Things to keep in mind 🌟

We will evaluate your project by assessing the overall strength and quality of the following five factors: 


#### Testing Best Practices

It's important to subscribe to a set of best practices when testing an Android app. Be mindful of these widely accepted principles:

*   
*   
*   

Using these principles will result in a high quality user experience while efficiently utilizing phone hardware resources and ensuring other developers can easily navigate through your code.

#### Testing thought process

Within the README, add a section that desccribes 'why' you tested a certain feature and how the process was etc
Include screenshots of features, screens, buttons, etc you tested


#### Version Control

We expect you to attempt to use version control best practices in your project. We will evaluate this by looking at the frequency of commits, commit messages, and diffs. We don’t expect you to be a pro with git, but we do expect you to be able to commit frequently rather than committing everything all at once.

## Submission Information 🚀

#### Submission Format

This repository will be your starting point. Please download (not clone or fork) this Github repository ([onramp-android-take-home](https://github.com/onramp-io/onramp-android-take-home)) and upload changes to a newly created repository. Once the Android application has been completed, you'll be submitting a link to the new repository you created. Prior to submitting your project, you should update the README file to provide the following information:

*   A high level architectural overview of your Android application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all components, including Activities, Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, etc. 
*   A brief description of any design patterns that you leveraged.
*   [Screenshots](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-screenshot) of each Activity View and descriptions of the overall user flow.

#### Submission Deadline + Process

You must submit your project by **9:00am PT/12:00pm ET, on January 13, 2020 using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFBo328et9VHd04fFTZ7MRfIUD5le-jimyl0UccCs3IBYHoQ/viewform).** Be sure that your project is viewable by the Onramp team in a **public** repository (you can make it private after January 28, 2021).

Once you’ve submitted your project, you are expected to stop working on it. Any commits that occur after submission or the deadline will not be reviewed.
