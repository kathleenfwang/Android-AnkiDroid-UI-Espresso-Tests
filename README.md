You will need to provide full test coverage for at least 8 features of the app. A feature could be "creating a new flaschard", "displaying the front and back of a flashcard", or "changing the flashcard font style".

We recommend that you identify the features you're most interested in testing, not what you think your interviewers or Onramp would like to see.

**Scope your testing coverage to what you can reasonably accomplish by the due date. Your test coverage must meet the following requirements:**

*   Use of at least four different [ViewMatchers](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/espresso/matcher/ViewMatchers)
*   Use of at least three different [ViewActions](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/espresso/action/ViewActions)
*   Use of at least two different [ViewAssertions](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/test/espresso/assertion/ViewAssertions)
*   Test coverage for at least five different Views

**Note: you will need to detail how your tests meet these requirements in your repository's README file when you submit your project.**

#### A Note on Researching and Plagiarism

You are actively encouraged to research the web, books, videos, or tutorials for this project. That said, we expect all code that is submitted to be your own (e.g. this project should **NOT** be completed with another person). That means that we expect each candidate to refrain from copying and/or pasting code into the project. If we find copied code in your project, we will have to disqualify you. Weâ€™ve included some suggested web and video resources at the end of this document.

## What we're looking for ðŸŒŸ

We will evaluate your project by assessing the overall strength and quality of the following 3 factors: 


#### UI Testing Anatomy

//Correct test anatomy

*   Find a view
*   Perform an action
*   Inspect the result

Using these principles will result in a high quality user experience while efficiently utilizing phone hardware resources and ensuring other developers can easily navigate through your code.

#### Testing Completion

//Full test coverage

#### Testing Success

//Passing tests

#### Version Control

We expect you to attempt to use version control best practices in your project. We will evaluate this by looking at the frequency of commits, commit messages, and diffs. We donâ€™t expect you to be a pro with git, but we do expect you to be able to commit frequently rather than committing everything all at once.

## Submission Information ðŸš€

#### Submission Format

This repository will be your starting point. Please download (not clone or fork) this Github repository ([onramp-android-take-home](https://github.com/onramp-io/onramp-android-take-home)) and upload changes to a newly created repository. Once the Android application has been completed, you'll be submitting a link to the new repository you created. Prior to submitting your project, you should update the README file to provide the following information:

*   A high level architectural overview of your Android application. e.g. names, relationships and purposes of all components, including Activities, Services, Content Providers, Broadcast Receivers, etc. 
*   A brief description of any design patterns that you leveraged.
*   [Screenshots](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-screenshot) of each Activity View and descriptions of the overall user flow.

//Within the README, add a section that desccribes 'why' you tested a certain feature and how the process was etc
Include screenshots of features, screens, buttons, etc you tested

#### Submission Deadline + Process

You must submit your project by **9:00am PT/12:00pm ET, on January 13, 2020 using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdFBo328et9VHd04fFTZ7MRfIUD5le-jimyl0UccCs3IBYHoQ/viewform).** Be sure that your project is viewable by the Onramp team in a **public** repository (you can make it private after January 28, 2021).

Once youâ€™ve submitted your project, you are expected to stop working on it. Any commits that occur after submission or the deadline will not be reviewed.
